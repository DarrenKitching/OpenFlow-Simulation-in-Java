# OpenFlow-Simulation-in-Java
A java application to simulate OpenFlow communication between three endnodes. There are eight routers who communicate with the controller to find the optimal path to the end destination. The controller uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the quickest journey from the hard-coded path and reports this to the routers.
